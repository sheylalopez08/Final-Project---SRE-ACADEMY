# Final Project - SRE Academy

## Overview
Welcome to the **My Cellphone App** project! This application was developed as part of the SRE Academy program and showcases the journey from initial setup to a fully functional, production-ready app. Our goal was to build a robust, scalable, and user-friendly solution while applying best practices in Site Reliability Engineering.

## Project Journey (Parts 1 to 6)
- **Part 1:** Project initialization, repository setup, and defining the architecture.
- **Part 2:** Implementing core features and ensuring modular design.
- **Part 3:** Containerization using Docker for consistent environments.
- **Part 4:** Deployment automation with CI/CD pipelines.
- **Part 5:** Monitoring and logging integration for reliability.
- **Part 6:** Final optimizations, security hardening, and documentation.

Each part built upon the previous one, resulting in a complete and reliable application.

## Key Features
- Modern architecture for scalability.
- Easy-to-use interface.
- Automated deployment and monitoring.

## Challenges and Solutions
Throughout development, we faced several challenges:
- **Merge Conflicts:** Resolved by adopting a clear branching strategy and using `git rebase`.
- **Deployment Issues:** Fixed by implementing containerization and CI/CD pipelines.
- **Performance Bottlenecks:** Addressed through code optimization and resource monitoring.

These obstacles taught us valuable lessons about collaboration, automation, and resilience.
